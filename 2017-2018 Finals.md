# First Question 
## Choose the correct answer: 
1. Deletion : because we can't delete the elements that we want to sort 

2. Yes : Example arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} arr[0] = 1, arr[3] = 4

3. LIFO : last element added to the stack is the first to get out. just like stacking trays on top of each other the last one 
          you add is the first one you retrieve 
          
4. Sorted : for example we have arr = [1,2,3,4,5] and since the main idea behind binary search is you look at the middle of
            array and look to your left and right, so if we wanna look for 2 we go to the mid value, 3, and see if 3 = 2 and 
            since it's not, then we check if 2 is bigger or smaller than 3 since it's smaller then we discard the right portion 
            of the array and do the same procedure for the left one. Now if the array wasn't sorted like that [5,1,3,4,2], I will
            check the mid value and it doesn't equal 2 and then I would discard the right portion because 2 should come before 3 
            but in this case I would be tossing out the portion that has my desired value.
5. "4" : [2,5,1,3,4] --> [2,1,5,3,4] (1) --> [2,1,3,5,4] (2) --> [2,1,3,4,5] (3) --> [1,2,3,4,5] (4) 

6. Binary search : see answer num 4 for better understanding 

7. Recursive: just like when u try to get the factorial of a number or implement binary search or merge sort, recursion is an elegant
              way to solve problems which see to repeat themselves in a way for more reference to recursion check : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz6tAJMVmfM

8.O(n) : Worst case scenario that could happen when we try to find an element in an array using linear search is when this 
         element is the last one in the array, meaning that in order to find it we have to go through n elements or make n steps 
         hence the O(n) time complexity 

9. Queue : just like the when people line to get the new Iphone, first one that arrives at the store is the first one that will 
           get the Iphone. First in First out. 

10. O(n) : because the best thing that could happen is that if the array was already sorted and if it was then bubble sort would 
           just pass through the array one time, hence make n moves.
   

# Second Question 

a)

    int Count(struct Node* head)

    {
      Node* tmp = head; // create a pointer that moves through the list
      int counter = 0; // counter to keep count of how many nodes there is 
     
      if (head == NULL) //list is empty... 
        return counter;
      
      while(tmp!=NULL)
      {
        counter++;
        tmp = tmp->next;
      }
      return counter;
      
    }

b)
    
    //Assuming the stack is made using an array... 
    void Remove_N(int N)
    {
      //first make sure our stack has N elements or more 
      if(top +1 != N)
      {
        cout<<"Insufficient number of elements in the stack"<<endl;
        exit(1)
      }
      for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      {
        pop();
      }
      return;
    }

c)

The strategy here is that we're gonna use a stack to reverse the Q. if the Q was [1,2,3,4,5], if we dequeue its elements in a 

stack then the newly created stack would be [1,2,3,4,5], and now we're gonna pop those elements into a Q again, but notice 

a stack follows a FILO or LIFO system, meaning that the first element that is gonna be poped is the 5 then 4 etc etc 

and hence the new Q would be : [5,4,3,2,1] 

    //Here we're gonna use the pre-implemented stack and Q in C++, contained in #include <stack> and #include <queue>
    // the syntax is queue<int> Queue or stack <int> stack. The <int> represents the data type of the elements inside them
    //reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reversing-a-queue/
    void Reverse(queue<int> &Queue, stack<int> &Stack)
    {
        while(!Queue.empty()) // keep going if Q not empty
        {
            Stack.push(Queue.front()); //dequeue the values into a stack 
            Queue.pop(); //empty the Q
        }
        while(!Stack.empty()) // make sure it's not empty 
        {
            Queue.push(Stack.top()); //pop the values into the Q 
            Stack.pop(); // empty the stack
        }
    }


d) 

    void Link_lists(node*&h1, node*&h2, int k)
    {
      // traverse pointers for list1 and list2
      node*trav1 = h1; 
      node*trav2 = h2;
      int counter = 0; // counter to track where we are 
      //special case if we want to insert the second list on top of the first...
      if(k == 0)
      {
        while(trav2->next != NULL) // reach the end to get the last node in the second list 
        {
          trav2 = trav2->next; 
        }
        trav2->next = h1; //make it point to the head of the first 
        h1 = h2; // make the head of the first point to the head of the second 
        return;
      }
      //reach the k-1 place in the first list 
      while(trav1->next != NULL && counter != k-1)
      {
        trav1 = trav1->next; 
        counter++;
      }
      //reach the end of the second list 
      while(trav2->next != NULL)
      {
        trav2 = trav2->next; 
      }
      // make trav2 point to the kth node and the k-1th node point to the head of list2 
      trav2->next = trav1->next; 
      trav1->next = h2; 

    }


# Third Question 

a) we first have to sort the array, I used Insertion sort because it's fast-ish and doesn't require lots of code. 
   There could be a smarter way than this, but that's the one I got 
   
   
    #include <iostream> 
    using namespace std ;


    void insertionSort(int x[], int n)
       {
	int key, j;

	for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
	{
		key = x[i]; 
		j = i-1;

		while(j>=0 && x[j] > key)
		{
			x[j+1] = x[j]; 
			j = j-1; 
		}
		x[j+1] = key;
	} 
        }

     void find_dup_miss(int arr[], int N)
        {
                    int duplicate, missing;
                    for(int i = 0; i < N-1; i++)
                    {
                              if(arr[i] == arr[i+1]) 
                                        duplicate = arr[i+1];
                              else if((arr[i+1] - arr[i]) != 1) // if the difference is greater than one then there's a num 
                                        missing = arr[i] + 1;   // missing in between 	 
                    }
                    cout<<"Duplicate number is " << duplicate<<endl; 
                    cout<<"missing number is " << missing<<endl; 
          }

       int main()
          {
                    int N; cin>>N;
                    int arr[N]; 
                    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
                    {
                              cin>>arr[i]; 
                    }
                    insertionSort(arr, N); 
                    find_dup_miss(arr, N); 
          }



b) 

1. It halves the Linked list by removing the even indices(if we start from 1 of course not 0) for example : 

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> end
1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> end

2. Since we constanty do 4 steps n times till we reach the end of the list, then the worst case complexity is O(4*n) --> O(n)

to understand this more, refer to : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25777714/which-algorithm-is-faster-on-or-o2n 

and since we could have just one element in the array, we would just create the pointers and exit the function, hence the 
best case complexity is O(1). 



# Fourth Question 

a) Insertion sort is just like when u try to sort a deck of cards in your hand you pick each card and put it in the correct order 

          Pseudocode : 
                    Input: 
                          pointer to the array
                          number of elements
                    Call the first element "Sorted" 
                    Repeat the following untill all elements are sorted 
                           look at the next unsorted element, insert it into the "sorted" portion by shiftting the 
                           requisite number of elements 
 
To understand this more refer to : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGb6ohsvUU&list=PLbLGXVr_ILCdQOy3p5P1hnGT-k80Q2uS6&index=36&t=0s 


b) 

         void insertionSort(int x[], int n)
          {
	   int key, j;

	   for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
	     {
		key = x[i]; 
		j = i-1;

		while(j>=0 && x[j] < key)
		{
			x[j+1] = x[j]; 
			j = j-1; 
		}
		x[j+1] = key;
	     } 
         } 



c) [4,5,6,10,14,19,2,15,20] ---> [4,5,6,10] ---> [4,5] --> [5]


d) 

1.

          Pseudocode : 
                    Check if number is less than 2
                          if it is then number is not prime 
                    Iterate from i = 2 till square_root(number) 
                          if number % i == 0, then number is not prime 
                          if not then number is prime 

To understand why we iterate till just sqrt(number) Check this : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5811151/why-do-we-check-up-to-the-square-root-of-a-prime-number-to-determine-if-it-is-pr  

They explain it very well. 


2. Worst case complexity is O(sqrt(n)) because the loop works (sqrt(n) + 1 ) and hence it could be rewritten as sqrt(n) 

PS : I"M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THE LAST ANSWER( Q4-d-2)... 

THE CODE : 

         bool is_prime(int n) 
          {
	   int j = sqrt(n) + 1  ;
	    if(n<2)
	{
	    return false ;
	}

        for(int i = 2 ; i < j ; i++)
	{
		
	    if(n % i == 0)
	       {
	          return false;
                 }
		

          }

           return true ;


          }
